# PCA on Banking Dataset
This dataset is to assess Deep Learning model's performance on Banking dataset provided with this assignment. Remember, same dataset we used during coverage of chapter 3. 

Prepare the dataset to be fed to Fully Connected Neural Network. With preparation, I mean convert all the categorial and string values to number representation acceptable for the neural network
Define a fully connected deep neural network with three hidden layers of 128, 64 and 32 with appropriate input and output layers. Remember column with title 'y' is output variable
Split the data in 70-30 for train and test
Train the model on all 20 input variables and report the test accuracy
Use PCA to extract first five principle components on this dataset and report test accuracy on these principle components 
How much variance is covered by these five components? Please discuss it inside a text cell
Repeat experiment 5 and 6, this time rather selecting five components, select as many as components are required to achieve minimum 70% test accuracy
How many components are required to achieve 70% performance?
